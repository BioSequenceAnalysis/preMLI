# preMLI
A pre-trained method to uncover miRNA-lnRNA patential interactions
# Introduction
This is a plant miRNA-lncRNA interaction prediction model preMLI based on pre-training and deep feature mining mechanism.

We use the RNA data in the public data set to obtain a more accurate embedding expression weight matrix through rna2vec pre-training.

We tested the prediction performance of the model on the benchmark dataset, and proved through experiments that the introduced pre-training mechanism and deep feature mining mechanism are effective.
